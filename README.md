## How to Run

*Recommended JAVA version 1.7.x*
We have two Eclipse projects under the following directories:

Server: `code/Server`

The server listens for UDP packets (datagrams) on port 5000.

Client: `code/Client`

The client communicates with the server using UDP datagrams.

To run, import Client and Server as separate projects in Eclipse. Right-click each project and click Properties.
Adjust the Java Build Path to include `lib/JSON.jar` as a jar.

### Running the server

Run the main in ServerMain.java

### Running GUI Client

Run the main in ClientMain.java (after running the server)

### Running the Tests

Add TestFramework in `/code` folder as a new project. Add the other projects (Server and Client) as part of the TestFramework project by right clicking the project in the sidebar --> Properties --> Java Build Path --> Projects Tab and add both projects. Then in the Libraries tab, add **JUnit 4**.

Then just run the project as JUnit tests. If any tests fail, file a bug.

## Messaging Format (JSON)

We decided to use JSON as our server/client data-interchange notation.
In order to use JSON with Java we needed to include a
library, in this case [org.json](http://www.json.org/java/index.html).

The jar file with the included classes for it are included in both projects under [project]/lib/JSON.jar. You will need to include the jar file in your build path. In Eclipse, expand the lib/ directory, right click on the jar file > Build Path > Add to Build Path.

Client -> Server: Message Specification
===
Json Message

|Key|Value|Description|
|---|-----|---|
|"pid"|int *(optional)*|Unique id of the client that sent the message *(Not necessary for register)*|

|"join"|Registers client for the game|Returns player ID on success, -1 on failure|
|"move"|Indicates the player just moved, expect "direction" in JSON object as well|Update players position|
|"button"|Indicates the player just pressed button (other than direction)| Calls relevant button handler|
|"load"|Indicates that we want to load a board state|Parses passed in JSONArray of board and stores the data in board for when the game gets started|



|Button *(String)*|Description|Outcome|
|---|---|---|
|"start"|Starts game| Sets game state to started|
|"end"|Ends the game| Sets game to ended|
|"reset"|Resets the player|Changes the players position|
|"deploy"|Indicates that a bomb was just dropped|Adds bomb to current game state|

|Direction *(String)*|
|---|
|"up"|
|"down"|
|"left"|
|"right"|

|type *(String)*|
|---|
|"player"|
|"spectator"|

|Bomb *(Object)*|key|value|
|---|---|---|
||"x"|int|
||"y"|int|


Server -> Client: Message Specification
===
Json Message

|Key|Value|Description|
|---|---|---|
|"type"|String|Indicates the type of message|
|"resp" *(optional)*|String|This will be either "Success" or "Failure", indicating the Servers response to their message|
|"game" *(optional)*|GameBoard|An object containing the current state of the game board|
|"pid" *(optional)*|int|Integer indicating the player id of for the client, will be -1 on failure.|


|type *(String)*|Description|
|---|---|
|"player_join"|This message will only be sent when a client tries to join as a Player. Response will include resp parameter which will indicate "Success" or "Failure", "Success" (ful) joins will include parameter pid which indicates their player id|
|"spectator_join"|This message will only be sent when a client tries to join as a Spectator. Response will include resp parameter which will indicate "Success" or "Failure"|
|"response"|This is a message for a single client that indicates an aditional parameter, "resp", which will indicate the success or failure of the request|
|"broadcast"|This message was broadcast to all players, indicting there is also a GameBoard object in the message.|
|"game_over"|Indicates the game is over, will be accompanied by ending game state|

|GameBoard *(object)*|Key|Value|Description|
|---|-----|---|---|
||"width"|int|width of the board|
||"height"|int|height of the board|
||board|[(GameObjectType)int][(GameObjectType)int]|A two dimensional integer array of GameObjectType defined in GameObjectType enum|

If one of the clients finishes the game (e.g. exits a door or collides with the last player on the board), the Server will not respond
with an updated board state, but will instead broadcast a `{â€œtype":"game_over"}` message to all players alerting them that the game is over.

## Testing & Test Framework

To run the tests, we have a JUnit system in place to run the units tests. All JUnit tests are within the TestFramework folder, which can be run easily.

Notes
===
#####From the project description:

- The door is hidden by default until number of enemies is 0 or it is stepped on, in Milestone 1, since there are no enemies, the door is never hidden. By default, in Milestone 2 and for testing purposes, the door is also not hidden.
