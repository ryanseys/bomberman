Code
===
*Recommended JAVA version 1.7.x*
We have two Eclipse projects under the following directories:

Server: `code/Server`

The server listens for UDP packets (datagrams) on port 5000.

Client: `code/Client`

The client communicates with the server using UDP datagrams.

## Messaging Format (JSON)

We decided to use JSON as our server/client data-interchange notation.
In order to use JSON with Java we needed to include a
library, in this case [org.json](http://www.json.org/java/index.html).

The jar file with the included classes for it are included in both projects under [project]/lib/JSON.jar. You will need to include the jar file in your build path. In Eclipse, expand the lib/ directory, right click on the jar file > Build Path > Add to Build Path.

Client -> Server: Message Specification
===
Json Message

|Key|Value|Description|
|---|-----|---|
|"pid"|int *(optional)*|Unique id of the client that sent the message *(Not necessary for register)*|
|"command"|Command|What command the player just entered|
|"button"|Button *(optional)*|What non direction button the client just pressed|
|"direction"| Direction *(optional)*| Direction that the player just moved|
|"bomb"|Bomb *(optional)*| Location that the player just dropped the bomb|

|Command *(String)*|Description|Outcome|
|--------|---|---|
|"join"|Registers client for the game|Returns player ID on success, -1 on failure|
|"move"|Indicates the player just moved, expect "direction" in JSON object as well|Update players position|
|"button"|Indicates the player just pressed button (other than direction)| Calls relevant button handler|
|"load"|Indicates that we want to load a board state|Parses passed in JSONArray of board and stores the data in board for when the game gets started|



|Button *(String)*|Description|Outcome|
|---|---|---|
|"start"|Starts game| Sets game state to started|
|"end"|Ends the game| Sets game to ended|
|"reset"|Resets the player|Changes the players position|
|"deploy"|Indicates that a bomb was just dropped|Adds bomb to current game state|

|Direction *(String)*|
|---|
|"up"|
|"down"|
|"left"|
|"right"|

|type *(String)*|
|---|
|"player"|
|"spectator"|

|Bomb *(Object)*|key|value|
|---|---|---|
||"x"|int|
||"y"|int|


Server -> Client: Message Specification
===
Json Message

|Key|Value|Description|
|---|---|---|
|"type"|String|Indicates the type of message|
|"resp" *(optional)*|String|This will be either "Success" or "Failure", indicating the Servers response to their message|
|"game" *(optional)*|GameBoard|An object containing the current state of the game board|
|"pid" *(optional)*|int|Integer indicating the player id of for the client, will be -1 on failure.|


|type *(String)*|Description|
|---|---|
|"player_join"|This message will only be sent when a client tries to join as a Player. Response will include resp parameter which will indicate "Success" or "Failure", "Success" (ful) joins will include parameter pid which indicates their player id|
|"spectator_join"|This message will only be sent when a client tries to join as a Spectator. Response will include resp parameter which will indicate "Success" or "Failure"|
|"response"|This is a message for a single client that indicates an aditional parameter, "resp", which will indicate the success or failure of the request|
|"broadcast"|This message was broadcast to all players, indicting there is also a GameBoard object in the message.|
|"game_over"|Indicates the game is over, will be accompanied by ending game state|

|GameBoard *(object)*|Key|Value|Description|
|---|-----|---|---|
||"width"|int|width of the board|
||"height"|int|height of the board|
||board|[(GameObjectType)int][(GameObjectType)int]|A two dimensional integer array of GameObjectType defined in GameObjectType enum|

If one of the clients finishes the game (e.g. exits a door or collides with the last player on the board), the Server will not respond
with an updated board state, but will instead broadcast a `{â€œtype":"game_over"}` message to all players alerting them that the game is over.

## Testing & Test Framework

You can see Testcases.md in the root folder of this project. 

To run tests, run Server.java. Then run TestMain.java. It will run all the tests and output the results to the console. It will also write a more detailed output to log files in the `/log` directory in the Client folder.

Notes
===
#####From the project description:
- The sending of the periodic update must proceed concurrently with ongoing
processing of player controls. The game state must be double-buffered.

- The door is hidden by default until number of enemies is 0 or it is stepped on, in Milestone 1, since there are no enemies, the door is never hidden.
